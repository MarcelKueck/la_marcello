## ⚡ Phase 1: Basic Functional Roaster

### Objectives
- Transform popcorn maker into working coffee roaster

- Consider adding manual temperature monitoring

#### 2. Separate Fan and Heater Control
**Why:** Independent control allows precise temperature management

**Steps:**
- Identify fan motor circuit

**Why:** Prevents beans from ejecting during roast

**Materials:**
- Aluminum flashing or soup can
- Heat-resistant construction
- 10-15cm height extension
- Optional: integrated chaff collector

#### 4. Temperature Monitoring (Manual)
**Materials:**
- K-type thermocouple (up to 400°C)
- Handheld thermometer with K-type input
- Position probe ~1cm above bean bed

### Testing Protocol
1. Start with 60-80g green beans
2. Preheat empty for 1 minute
3. Add beans, monitor temperature
4. Target temperature progression:
   - 0-3 min: 150-170°C (drying phase)
   - 3-8 min: 170-205°C (Maillard reactions)
   - First crack: ~205°C
   - 8-12 min: 205-225°C (development)
   - Second crack: ~225°C (if desired)

### Success Criteria

## 📝 Notes & Considerations

### Key Success Factors
1. **Safety First:** Never compromise on safety features
2. **Iterative Development:** Build, test, learn, repeat
3. **Community Engagement:** Share progress, gather feedback
4. **Data-Driven:** Log everything for ML training
5. **User-Centric:** Design for coffee lovers, not engineers

### Potential Challenges
- Thermal management in compact housing
- Consistent airflow with variable bean quantities
- ML model accuracy with limited training data
- Regulatory compliance costs
- Manufacturing complexity and costs
- Market education (why roast at home?)

### Unique Selling Points
- **Only AI-powered home roaster**
- **Scan-to-roast with curated beans**
- **Open-source community-driven**
- **Professional features at home price**
- **Complete ecosystem (roaster + beans + knowledge)**

## 🎓 Philosophy

This project embodies the maker spirit: taking affordable consumer hardware and transforming it into something extraordinary through creativity, engineering, and community. Like Gaggiuino did for espresso, we're democratizing precision coffee roasting.

The goal isn't just to build a product, but to create a movement. A community of coffee enthusiasts who control their entire coffee journey from green bean to perfect cup.

**"The best coffee roaster is the one that helps you make better coffee."**
